# pocs
Personal profile of proof of concepts (POCs) to explore, test, and validate ideas across different areas of software engineering.
This GitHub profile is a collection of experiments, prototypes, and small projects where I learn, test frameworks, and showcase how different technologies can be applied to real-world problems.
